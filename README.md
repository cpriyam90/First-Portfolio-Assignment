# Priyam-Portfolio

## Description

My first portfolio to enable a potential employer to see the quality of my work and my skill set.

## Applications Used

HTML, CSS, Advanced CSS, Responsive CSS

## Usage

This portfolio was made to not only showcase my work to an employer but to meet the criteria listed below. It also highlights the use of CSS Variables, Flex box and Media Queries to develop a responsive webpage

## User Story

* AS AN employer
* I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
* SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
* WHEN I load their portfolio
* THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
* THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
* THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
* THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
